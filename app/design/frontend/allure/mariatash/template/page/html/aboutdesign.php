<p><strong>Maria Tash has been a designer and retailer of fine jewelry for over 13 years. Her interest began at a young age after attending a jewelry design class with her mother. However, this affinity did not fully bloom into a career until some years later after studying in London. There she discovered her appreciation for the art of body piercing and a love of Indian and Pakistani designs, most notably nostril and ear jewelry.</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Upon returning to the states she decided to turn her passion into a business after realizing how hard it was to find a highly regarded place that specialized in fine body art. It was not before long when Maria opened her first piercing and tattoo spa in New York City. Soon thereafter, noticing most all navel pieces sold were made only of industrial steel and lacking overall quality and style, Maria's talent and innovation started to take effect. She promptly began to design her own line of fine navel jewelry. Faced with the challenge of creating pieces that were not only hypoallergenic and strong, but also comfortable and beautiful, Maria set out to do just that. And to ensure that her jewelry met the highest of her standards, she wore each design herself to test its durability and comfort.</p>
<p>As the industry began to flourish so did Maria's desire to expand her collections. Now including earrings, finger rings, necklaces and more, Maria utilizes the same standards and design techniques as her navel pieces to insure that her customers receive nothing but the utmost quality in fine jewelry. In addition to having attended New York's Fashion Institute of Technology for jewelry making and design, Maria keeps current on the latest trends and innovations in the fashion industry through journals, lectures and seminars&hellip; and most importantly through her constant interaction with her customers. She is considered an authority in the field of body piercing and has discussed the many facets of the industry in various television and print media outlets including:</p>
<p><strong>MTV, The Today Show, ABC News, The View, Vogue, The Village Voice, Daily News </strong></p>
<p>Maria Tash is a member and officer of the Armenian Jewelers Association and holds the appointment of Secretary.</p>
